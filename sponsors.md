## Enmap Partners

### An Idiot's Guide

My home for many years, way before Enmap was even a thought, AIG has been the place where I can be myself. That is, be sometimes of an asshole and sometimes helpful to beginners wanting to learn discord.js. Sometimes both at the same time! 

AIG helps users with discord.js support for version 11 and 12, has a channel for Enmap, and is a community of builders. Notably, we're the authors of the famous [An Idiot's Guide to Discord.js](https://anidiots.guide/) \(if that wasn't obvious\), where I'm the main author but there have been many contributions over the year. For discord.js support, head on over to [https://anidiots.guide/](https://anidiots.guide/) for the guide itself and [https://discord.gg/4NE4bk7](https://discord.gg/4NE4bk7) to join us on Discord.

### BlueFox Hosting

Over the years there's always been a need for free hosting that works for Discord bots. While there are some options out there, BlueFox has the mission to give back to the community directly by offering a free basic Discord Bot Hosting plan that should suffice for many users, as well as arguably some of the cheapest paid hosting around. While this service is not a full VPS with console access, it offers online editing, Git integration, and pre-installed with most of the dependencies you'll need on your bot : the build tools and python for better-sqlite3, FFMPEG for music bots, and more. 

BlueFox supports Enmap fully, it's super easy to install both Enmap and better-sqlite3 there, so I highly recommend it for hosting your enmap-powered project!

To nab yourself a great place to host your project for free, head on over to the [Discord Bot Hosting on BlueFox.Tech](https://bluefox.tech/discord.php)!
